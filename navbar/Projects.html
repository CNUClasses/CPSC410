                     <li>Please include system includes before user includes (<> before "")</li>
                     <li>Please clean code before turn in. Do not leave extraneous print statements.  Makes the solution look a bit rushed and rubbishy.  If you insists on print statements, use a logging library instead.</li>
                     <li>Please do not leave an unseemly amount of whitespace and/or commented out code in your solution. Makes an instant bad impression. Use source control (git) to manage your software versions. </li>

                  For this project, please DO NOT use the PRINTx functions the following way;<br>

                  thread t1(PRINT4,s);<br>

                  <p>It takes a very long time to start a thread, and a very short time to call the PRINTx function.  You spend almost all of your time starting and tearing down the threads.
                     <br><br>Instead in <br>
                     void startThreads(std::string s, int numThreads, WHICH_PRINT wp, int numTimesToPrint, int millisecond_delay);<br>

                     launch numThreads threads passing the paraemeters std::string s,  WHICH_PRINT wp, int numTimesToPrint, int millisecond_delay to the thread function that you specify.
                     <br><br>
                     Please see sample project "Stopping a thread cleanly" for details on cooperatively stopping a thread<br>
                      Please do not call joinThreads in startThreads!  You should always code to the API.  If something is wrong with the API then get buy-in from all stakeholders before you 
                        implement extra behaviour.<br>
                        Please do not place a main() function in any of the files you turn in.  As mentioned in the project writeup, I am going to use my main(), defined in my main.cpp, and your files to test your code.<br>
