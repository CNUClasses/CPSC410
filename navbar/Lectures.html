						<strong><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/atomic/"> Atomics </a></strong> Useful BUT can only synchronize 1 C++ operation at a time.<br>
						<strong><a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/CPSC410/blob/master/content/Lectures/threads_raceconditions_criticalsections.pdf">Threads, Race conditions, critical sections, atomics</a></strong>A multithreaded introduction<br>
						Takeaways:<br>
						<li>Threads - know how to set up your C++ project to use threads (compiler set to use C++ 11 minimum, add the pthread library).  See <a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/CPSC327/blob/master/content/Lectures/Eclipse_Customizations.pdf" > Eclipse Customizations</a> for more info.</li>
						Threaded applications can be proven incorrect, but not correct since you cant control the scheduler.  Therefore testing is not as helpful.  Your only defense is to write perfect code, to do this there are some rules to follow. <br>
						Rigid Requirements!<br>
						<ul>
							<li>If you start a thread (thread t1(fun)) you must wait for it to finish (t1.join())!</li>
							<li>Never, ever rely on knowledge of system behavior to predict thread run order! You cant tell! (see <a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/Thread_Race_Condition.git">Thread_Race_Condition</a>) </li>
							<li>Learn to identify minimal critical sections.  You want them to be as small as possible since only 1 thread can be in the critical section at a time, the others block and wait.</li>
							<li>To identify critical sections, start by finding all variables that multiple threads can access.  This includes all globals, and all non-threadsafe API's used (like cout) </li>
							<li>Are these globals accessed by more than 1 thread? You probably have critical sections that need protection (synchronization).</li>
							<li>the exception to this rule is a global that is only read,  never written.  BUT the very first time the global is written it needs protection (synchronization) on every Read and write</li>
							<li>Atomic classes are great, iff you have a single line critical section.  For multiple lines, you need a mutex (coming next)</li>
							
						</ul>

					Four conditions need to hold for a deadlock to occur:

						   <li>Mutual exclusion: Threads claim exclusive control of resources

						  <li>Hold-and-wait: Threads hold resources allocated to them (e.g., locks

						  <li>No preemption: Resources (e.g., locks) cannot be forcibly removed

						  thread holds one or more resources (e.g., locks) that are being

					Note: Mutexes are incorrect since the thread that locks a mutex must be the same thread that unlocks the mutex. The mutex form of this solution makes no provision for this.<br>  The fix?  Use a semaphore instead of a mutex since it has no such restriction.  </a></strong><br/>
