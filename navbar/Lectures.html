<!--		<strong><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/atomic/"> Atomics </a></strong> Useful BUT can only synchronize 1 C++ operation at a time.<br>
				<strong><a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/CPSC410/blob/master/content/Lectures/thread_race_condition_critical_sections_atomics.pdf">Threads, Race conditions, critical sections, atomics</a></strong>A multithreaded introduction
				
				Takeaways:<br>
				<li>Threads - know how to set up your C++ project to use threads (compiler set to use C++ 11 minimum, add the pthread library).  See <a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/CPSC327/blob/master/content/Lectures/Eclipse_Customizations.pdf" > Eclipse Customizations</a> for more info.</li>
				Threaded applications can be proven incorrect, but not correct since you cant control the scheduler.  Therefore testing is not as helpful.  Your only defense is to write perfect code, to do this there are some rules to follow. <br>
				Rigid Requirements!<br>
				<ul>
					<li>If you start a thread (thread t1(fun)) you must wait for it to finish (t1.join())!</li>
					<li>Never, ever rely on knowledge of system behavior to predict thread run order! You cant tell! (see <a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/Thread_Race_Condition.git">Thread_Race_Condition</a>) </li>
					<li>Learn to identify minimal critical sections.  You want them to be as small as possible since only 1 thread can be in the critical section at a time, the others block and wait.</li>
					<li>To identify critical sections, start by finding all variables that multiple threads can access.  This includes all globals, heap based variables that multiple threads are aware of, and all non-threadsafe API's used (like cout) </li>
					<li>Are these globals accessed by more than 1 thread? You probably have critical sections that need protection (synchronization).</li>
					<li>the exception to this rule is a shared variable that is only read,  never written.  BUT the very first time it's written it needs protection (synchronization) on every read and write</li>
					<li>Atomic classes are great, IFF you have a single line critical section.  For multiple lines, you need a mutex (coming next)</li>
					
				</ul>

					Mutexes<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Mutexes are almost certainly going to be global variables (they will NOT be local variables)</li>
						<li>Mutexes function as a traffic cop, they allow 1 thread in a critical section at a time(others threads are blocked)</li>
						<li>Prefer a lock_guard over a raw mutex since it automatically unlocks when it goes out of scope</li>
						<li>To use: Identify minimal critical sections, then wrap critical section with an auto unlocking lock_guard</li>
					</ul>

						Please read Chapter 32, Common Concurrency Problems - pay attention to Deadlock and the section entitled 'Conditions for Deadlock' (see below)<br>
						Four conditions need to hold for a deadlock to occur:
						<ul>
							   <li>Mutual exclusion: Threads claim exclusive control of resources 
							  that they require (e.g., a thread grabs a lock).</li>
							  <li>Hold-and-wait: Threads hold resources allocated to them (e.g., locks 
							  that they have already acquired) while waiting for additional resources 
							  (e.g., locks that they wish to acquire).</li>
							  <li>No preemption: Resources (e.g., locks) cannot be forcibly removed 
							  from threads that are holding them.</li>
							  <li>Circular wait: There exists a circular chain of threads such that each
							  thread holds one or more resources (e.g., locks) that are being 
							  requested by the next thread in the chain.</li>
						</ul>
						<br><strong>Deadlock Rule of thumb:</strong> If you are using 2 or more synchronization objects, then you should always aquire them in the same order.  If you break this rule and some threads aquire in different order then your code is prone to deadlock.<br>

				spent 2 lectures on forcing students to code thread ticket agent
				start with sequential solution  (deterministic ? always)
				then add threads (dont join have app crash)
				then add mutex (raw then lock)
				then lock guard
				then other mutexes (to increase concurrency)
				day 2
				changed report to be more general
				added synchronized theatre class where patrons go when they have bought a ticket
				talked about deadlock, usually occurs if have 2 sync objects A and B.  Thread 1 holds A and wants B.  Thread 2 holds B and wants A.  But can occure if you lock the same object twice in same thread without interveningunlock
				added a Theatre to ticket agent
				at their request put the mutex to protect entry and exit from theatre outside class, showed how that led to messy code and hard to use class
			    showed where deadlock can occur in theatre if locking same mutex twice-->

			<strong><a href="https://github.com/CNUClasses/CPSC410/blob/master/content/Lectures/Semaphore.pdf"> Semaphores </a></strong>Think of semaphores as bouncers at a nightclub. There are a dedicated number of people that are allowed in the club at once. If the club is full no one is allowed to enter, but as soon as 
			one person leaves another person might enter. It's simply a way to limit the number of consumers for a specific resource. For example, to limit the number of simultaneous calls to a database in an application.Or to limit the number of widgets produced before stopping and waiting for a consumer to catch up.  BTW a mutex can be represented as a semaphore that only lets one thread in the protected critical section at a time.<br>

						Thursday December 9, 8am-10:30am (2.5 hours long)<br>
						
						<br>
						 Similar format to Midterms<br>
						 The test will be given to you on paper. <br>
						 You may bring 5 sheets of paper with notes on both sides. No other resources are allowed.<br> 
						 <br>
						 It's Comprehensive:<br>
						 All course material is fair game<br>
						 Difference between cooperative and pre emptive multitasking OS's<br>
						 Process scheduling, scheduling algorithms, metrics<br>
						 Virtual memory, simple and multilevel page tables, TLB's<br>
						 Policy (clock, FIFO, Optimal, Least Recently used)<br>

						 There will be be a multithreaded problem to solve that requires some combonation of threads, mutexes, condition variables and semaphores<br>
						 There will be at least 1 question on deadlock<br>
						 There will be a question on disk drive throughput<br>

						 THATS IT FOR THE HINTS, GOOD LUCK!<BR></strong> <br>
